# PennX-SD1x

This repository is for the assigments I did on Software Development Fundamentals course on edX by University of Pennsylvania.

Course Description:

This course, part of the Computer Science Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, will quickly cover Java syntax and keywords and then explore features of object-oriented programming including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You will learn how to appply these concepts to programmatic problem-solving by investgating class modeling techniques and relationships such as aggregation, realization, and generalization.
